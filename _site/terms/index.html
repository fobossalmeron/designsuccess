<h2>With Company</h2>
<p>
A. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and all aspects of the Website and Company Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in USA County, State of Nevada, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded from this Agreement. Additionally, application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from this Agreement. In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Website or Company Services be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.</p>
<p>
B. Informal Resolution. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least ninety (90) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other.
</p><p>
C. Binding Arbitration. If you and Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in USA County, State of Nevada. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>
D. Restrictions. You and Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Company and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p>
E. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of any of your or Company’s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief. If this Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Company will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<h2>WHAT IS A TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT?</h2>

<p>A Terms of Use Agreement is a written set of rules and regulations between two parties, the User and the Company, that the User must agree to follow in order to use the Company’s website and services.</p>

<h2>WHEN IS A TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT NEEDED?</h2>
<p>
While Terms and Conditions are not required by law, any website, especially e-commerce or social networking websites or applications and any website or internet service provider that stores a User’s personal data, should consider having Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>
A written set of Terms and Conditions protects the Company and acts an instruction manual for its website. It allows the Company to explain things related to its service or product, including, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li> how purchases, payment, and returns are handled</li> 
<li> ownership and use of content and intellectual property</li>
<li> how Users must conduct themselves, including any prohibited behavior</li>
<li> limitations on liability and disclaimers</li>
<li>the Company’s privacy policy</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHO NEEDS A TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT?</h2>

<p>Almost every website or application that provides a service or product has a Terms of Use Agreement.
<br /><br />
Here are some examples of websites and apps that use a Terms of Use Agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-Commerce Company - Ebay, Amazon, Target, Gap</li>
<li>Social Media Website or Application - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat</li>
<li>Search Engine - Google, Yahoo, Bing</li>
<li>Website or Application</li>
<li>Providing a Service or Product - YouTube, Apple, Uber</li>
<li>Gaming Website or Application - Playstation, Pokemon Go, Candy Crush</li>
</ul>
<h2>WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A TERMS OF USE?</h2>

<p>A simple Terms of Service should generally have at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the Company providing the service or product</li>
<li>What is the service or product provided by the Company</li>
<li>Where is the Company’s website</li>
<li>When will the agreement terminate</li>
<li>Why might the User not be granted access to the website</li>
<li>How does the User agree to accept the Terms of Service</li>
</ul>

<p>The Company can tailor the rules and regulations, or “terms of use”, according to the service or product it provides and its specific needs. The Terms of Use Agreement can be posted on the Company’s website either as a browsewrap agreement or a clickwrap agreement.</p>
